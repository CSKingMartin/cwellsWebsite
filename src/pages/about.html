			<p>I'm Conner Wells, a budding developer just beginning to enter the "Computer Science" field. Although I have one more year to complete at Linfield College as an undergrad, I'm getting experience working as an intern for Connective DX currently in Portland, OR. There I'm learning and getting experience as a Front-End Developer Intern. While Web Development looks to be my focus in the future, I also have educational experience in Programming, Database Management, Software Development, as well as rudimentary Cyber-Security. See examples of my work <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

			<h1>Where am I now?</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="body">
			<p>I spent most of my childhood in a small town called Enumclaw, in WA state. After High School I relocated a little further south to Oregon as I pursued a higher education. As of Summer of 2016, I'm lucky enough to be staying in beautiful Lake Oswego, OR while completing my internship at Connective DX. During the school year, I attend Linfield College in McMinnville, OR, pursuing a B.A in Computer Science, with minors in Math and Political Science.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>In my short time working with Computer Science, I've already developed a passion for the problem solving and people involved. I enjoy coming up with clever solutions to problems, and making clean, natural content. Since I began considering my future career, my bottom line has always been to create and to help. My passion lies in doing work for others -- for a greater body than myself, and I hope to find a home somewhere that my talents are honed, well used, and helpful. </p>
