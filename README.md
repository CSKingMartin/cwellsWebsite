# Personal Website
Part of my initial project at ConnectiveDX, using the framework I've built to develop a personal website.

#Origin:
I've just signed on as an intern at ConnectiveDX, a web dev/software dev company in Portland, OR. (https://www.connectivedx.com/) Their first task for me has been to create a Web Framework for myself, and build a website from said framework so that I can be able to find my way around the tools and process involved for future company projects I'll be working on.

For more info on what I'm using, and the details of the framework, please visit https://github.com/CSKingmartin/frameworkProject.

If you would like to keep track of my thought process as well as progress, please visit https://cscwells.wordpress.com/ for more information.
