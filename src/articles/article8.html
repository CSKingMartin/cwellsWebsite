<h1>Version 1.0 and Rebuilding</h1>
<h3>June 23, 2016</h3>

<h2>The good news:</h2>
I've finished an initial, maintainable version of my website. I'm taking a break at the moment from code-cleaning to blog (because code-cleaning isn't fun).
<br><br>
I talked a lot with a few people at Connective DX about their own personal websites, and the purpose they had. It was a good conversation -- I feel like entering this field is not something that's by any means traditional. For the most part my general understanding is that when job-hunting or putting your skills out there you need the resume and cover letter.
<br><br>
With the web development industry, and probably many Computer Science fields, your experiences that you would highlight in a resume don't always matter. The field is changing so quickly, that most of the tools and skills associated with them could be irrelevant in the next 5 years.
<br><br>
This makes a personal website extremely valuable. Not only is it your chance to provide a portfolio of work (showing is better than telling), it can itself serve as an example or a hub of examples that showcase new technologies and tools. Proving your adaptability, and grappling with new and undocumented content is likely what hiring companies are looking for. Computer Science is a fluid industry, and we must be able to move with it.
<h2>The (kind of) bad news:</h2>
I already want to scrap my site and make it leagues better than it is now. Some of these "wants" are purely cosmetic, some functional, but ideally I want to be discovering and creating really really cool stuff, and showing it off. Coworker-Evan was correct in saying that I'll be redesigning my website for my entire life. Really this is awesome. It's exciting and incentive to challenge myself. I want to become, and maintain being, relevant in this workforce.
<br><br>
I think next week my time spent exclusively on my personal development at Connective DX ends, and my time doing a bit of actual work begins. Meanwhile, my idea notebook and my overall journey is just beginning (isn't that quaint and sentimental?).
