<h1>Moving in a New Direction</h1>
<h3>July 5, 2016</h3>

Whilst starting off my morning today I realised: I haven't made a new blog post in a while. So here we are!
<h2>The Website - then until now</h2>
My website (as you all can seeÂ <a href="http://cskingmartin.github.io/cwellsWebsite/">here</a>) hasn't changed at all since I last wrote. I still have these great ideas of moving in new directions with the site, and I'm in the process of moving to Handlebars.js instead of Nunjucks for templating. Just finding my way around Handlebars has taken up a lot of my time in itself. I think sense there isn't a real sense of urgency to get something that works online, I can really take my time with 2.0 and have a nice start-to-finish dev process.
<h2>In Other News</h2>
I'm doing other work for Connective DX! I've been tasked with helping writing a plugin for Gulp that will be used with the next iteration of Phoenix (Connective DX's framework). This feels like a very new direction from developing web pages, and I am eternally grateful. Not that I don't love web dev, but I'm tired at looking at my green-and-white site.

This means I'm writing LOTS of Javascript, which is awesome. I've missed coding, and while this isn't algorithm-heavy it certainly forces me to understand and think more about the details and inner workings of many of the things I've taken and used in my own framework. Learning how to write Gulp plugins was something I had wanted to do since I saw the build tool. Now I'm not only getting to do that, I'm helping Connective DX which is extremely rewarding.
<h2>What now?</h2>
I have a deadline to get this plugin finished (or have something to present at least) by tomorrow, and I have a bit to go. I think after I've finished the plugin, not only will I host it but I'll be able to write down what I've learned in the process as well here. Good morning, thanks for reading, and I'll see you soon.
