<h1>For lack of a better title -- Week 2</h1>
<h3>June 14, 2016</h3>

<h2>Lots of Stuff has happened</h2>
<h5>One</h5>
This post comes a little late, as many little things have progressed over the week, but fewer of the "eureka" moments. Working at Connective DX gets better every day. I'm able to develop in the best kind of environment surrounded by extremely intelligent people, and while my progress is slower than last week it's still breakneck compared to what I accomplished during last semester.

In the immense space I have to wiggle around and experiment, I've decided to try and create a site that will replace this Wordpress blog at the very least. I've worked with Ruby on Rails before -- which had a lot of build in structure to get exactly that type of website up and running in an extremely quick fashion. Building it from scratch is going to look very different, but I'm taking it in steps.
<h5>Two</h5>
It's pretty time consuming at first for myself to create these tiny pieces. I consider myself a perfectionist and I have a hard time moving on to solving another problem if it means leaving one unfinished.

A quick way to get prototype websites up, and test layouts it to use some existing frameworks like Bootstrap, or Flexboxgrid which come with most of these tiny pieces already assembled. What tends to happen once used often is that budding developers become reliant on these (and I don't want to do that for many reasons, but mostly so I can have the experience of building these pieces myself). They also often include many many things that a single website won't use. They're all encompassing, "one-size-fits-all" style collections that ship tons of extra data back and forth between websites and servers. At worst case, this can make your website slower, and extremely inefficient.

As such, part of my work this last week has been moving away from using these models.
<h5>Three</h5>
I had planned before starting this internship to use what I learn over summer to jumpstart my Senior Capstone next year. As a part of my degree, I'm required to research, create, and present a product of my choice be it an essay, application, etc.

I think this last week I've decided on what I want to do, and I'm pretty darn excited.

I want to develop a front-end framework for the Computer Science department at Linfield to use. A lot of what I get to do now is what I wish I had access to while taking a Web Development course last semester. If I had had access to the framework I've build now last semester, the growing pains of learning basic HTML and CSS would have been eased greatly. If I can make something that could give that experience to other students, not only would I be accelerating the learning process of the more essential concepts, they could be exposed as well to the framework and tools that are so prolific in the modern industry.
<h4>In conclusion</h4>
There's lots of work ahead in building my website. I'll post some of the kinks and problems later that I've had in a more specific manner. For now, I'll end this here.
